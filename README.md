# TVShowFile
Python 3 OOP TV Show Rip filename parser

After a lot of searching I have found some python programs which can parse and
check TV show Names and Series/Episodes and check against TVDB.

All examples however do not appear easy to use to build additional functionality
into other programs.

This is project is to give similar functionality as found in the Perl module
Video::Filename which does not do anything more than parse and extract required
information which can then be used within another program.

I hope this might be found to be of use to others in the future.
