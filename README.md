# TVShowFile
Python 3 OOP TV Show Rip filename parser

I have not been able to find an independent module for parsing filename in
 Python.

All examples that I was able to find appear to be tied to a project that goes
beyond parsing the filename and moves into TVDB
queries or filename renaming.

This is project is to give some functionality as found in the Perl module
Video::Filename
